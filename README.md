# Installation
User will need the Inquirer and Axios packages installed to use the feature (and Node.js of course).

# Usage
Once packages and JS files are installed, run "node index" on the command line. Answer the questions; a .md file will be created. Save the .md file with a new name in the desired repository folder, and you're done!

# Contributing
Create a new branch, and start a pull request. Please detail why you're interested in contributing in the comments.

# Tests
This document right here is a test of this very application!

# Future Development
I'd like to make the profile photo smaller, as well as use JS to dynamically create a table of contents. Also add a field to list the GitHub avatar for other contributors!
